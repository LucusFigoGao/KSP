find the K-shortest path by Yen's Algorithm

With the continuous development of production and life, it is hard to  meet people's basic needs when only calculate the shortest path. 
In many fields such as electrical and transportation, it is often more favored to find the K shortest paths.In 1972, Yen gave a solution
to find the K shortest path, we are accustomed to call it deviated path algorithm, which also called Yen's algorithm. Based on Yen's paper
we  complete the K shortest path solution through MATLAB programming
You just need to enter the edge weight relationship b in the command line window, and give the directional judgment of the graph, then
the K shortest paths can be output.
